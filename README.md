# Type hints - Inside the snake pit

Type hints in Python were initially introduced in 2015. Since, then the type annotation system has gone through multiple
improvement cycles, and can be now considered a mature and stable part of the language.

Join Bloomberg Engineering to learn about type hinting and how tools such as mypy leverage it. We will discuss the when,
what, how and why to add type annotations to your code; and present some challenges you might run into while doing so.
Finally, we'll show how to automatically inject this information into your documentation.
